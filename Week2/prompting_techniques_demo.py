Subject: Order #12345 - Wrong Item Received

Hi there,

I ordered a blue sweater (size M) last week but received a red jacket (size L) instead. 
This is really frustrating because I needed it for an event tomorrow. 

Can you please help me get the right item or process a refund quickly?

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson
