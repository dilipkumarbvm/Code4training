Simple AI Chatbot
==================

A basic chatbot that sends your input to OpenAI and displays the response.
Perfect for exploring how LLMs work and experimenting with prompts.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Loads your OpenAI API key from environment variables
2. Creates a connection to OpenAI's servers
3. Starts a simple chat loop:
   - Gets your input
   - Sends it to OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model
   - Displays the AI's response
   - Repeats until you type 'quit'

Requirements:
- OpenAI API key (set as environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY)
- Python packages: openai, python-dotenv
