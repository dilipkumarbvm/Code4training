## What You'll Learn This Week

### Core Topics
- **Advanced AI Techniques**: Moving beyond simple chat interactions
- **Data Handling**: Working with different types of input and output
- **Application Architecture**: Building more complex, structured applications
- **Integration Patterns**: Connecting AI with other systems and data sources

### Technical Skills
- Enhanced Python programming techniques
- Working with external data sources
- Error handling and validation patterns
- Code organization and modularity
- Testing and debugging strategies

## Prerequisites

Before starting Week 2, make sure you have:

âœ… **Completed Week 1**: Understanding of basic OpenAI API usage  
âœ… **Working Development Environment**: Python, pip, and text editor set up  
âœ… **Active OpenAI API Key**: With some remaining credits  
âœ… **Git Repository**: Cloned and up to date with latest changes  

## Week 2 Structure

As we progress through the week, new projects and exercises will be added to this folder. Each project will include:

- **Detailed README**: Explaining the project goals and concepts
- **Complete Code Examples**: Ready-to-run applications
- **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Clear setup and execution guides
- **Practice Exercises**: Hands-on activities to reinforce learning

## Getting Started

### 1. Pull Latest Changes
Make sure you have the most recent course materials:

**Using Command Line:**
```bash
git pull origin main
```

**Using GitHub Desktop:**
- Open GitHub Desktop
- Select the code4training repository
- Click "Fetch origin" then "Pull origin"

### 2. Check Your Environment
Verify your development environment is ready:

```bash
# Check Python version
python --version

# Verify OpenAI library is installed
pip show openai

# Test your API key is working (optional)
python -c "from openai import OpenAI; print('âœ… OpenAI library ready')"
```

### 3. Review Week 1 Concepts
Take a moment to review:
- How to use environment variables for API keys
- Basic OpenAI API structure and parameters
- Python fundamentals: loops, conditionals, error handling
- Reading and modifying existing code

## What's Coming

Throughout this week, you can expect to see:

- **New Project Folders**: Each containing complete applications
- **Progressive Complexity**: Building from simple to more advanced concepts
- **Real-World Applications**: Practical examples you can adapt for your own use
- **Collaborative Exercises**: Opportunities to work with classmates
- **Take-Home Assignments**: Practice projects to reinforce learning
